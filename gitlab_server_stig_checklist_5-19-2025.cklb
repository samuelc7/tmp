Successful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset.

This does not mean the operating system terminates all sessions or network access; it only ends the unresponsive session and releases the resources associated with that session.\n\nRHEL 9 utilizes /etc/ssh/sshd_config for configurations of OpenSSH. Within the sshd_config, the product of the values of \"ClientAliveInterval\" and \"ClientAliveCountMax\" are used to establish the inactivity threshold. The \"ClientAliveInterval\" is a timeout interval in seconds, after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The \"ClientAliveCountMax\" is the number of client alive messages that may be sent without sshd receiving any messages back from the client. If this threshold is met, sshd will disconnect the client.

In addition, quickly terminating an idle SSH session will also free up resources committed by the managed network element.\n\nTerminating network connections associated with communications sessions includes, for example, deallocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at the operating system level and deallocating networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single operating system-level network connection. This does not mean the operating system terminates all sessions or network access; it only ends the unresponsive session and releases the resources associated with that session.\n\nRHEL 9 utilizes /etc/ssh/sshd_config for configurations of OpenSSH. Within the sshd_config, the product of the values of \"ClientAliveInterval\" and \"ClientAliveCountMax\" are used to establish the inactivity threshold. The \"ClientAliveInterval\" is a timeout interval in seconds, after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The \"ClientAliveCountMax\" is the number of client alive messages that may be sent without sshd receiving any messages back from the client.

Security function is defined as the hardware, software, and/or firmware of the information system responsible for enforcing the system security policy and supporting the isolation of code and data on which the protection is based. Security functionality includes, but is not limited to, establishing system accounts, configuring access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges), setting events to be audited, and setting intrusion detection parameters.\n\nThis requirement applies to operating systems performing security function verification/testing and/or systems and environments that require this functionality.\n\nPreventing nonprivileged users from executing privileged functions mitigates the risk that unauthorized individuals or processes may gain unnecessary access to information or privileges.\n\nPrivileged functions include, for example, establishing accounts, performing system integrity checks, or administering cryptographic key management activities. Nonprivileged users are individuals who do not possess appropriate authorizations. Circumventing intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms or malicious code protection mechanisms are examples of privileged functions that require protection from nonprivileged users.","false_positives":"","false_negatives":"","documentable":"false","security_override_guidance":"","potential_impacts":"","third_party_tools":"","ia_controls":"","responsibility":"","mitigations":"","mitigation_control":"","legacy_ids":["SV-70979","V-56719"],"ccis":["CCI-002235"],"reference_identifier":"5551","uuid":"32af8f5c-4ffd-41f3-82c4-ab437e0bf612","stig_uuid":"10605b16-6632-41a8-93bb-c8a68077453b","status":"not_a_finding","overrides":{},"comments":"","finding_details":""}]}],"active":false,"mode":2,"has_path":true,"target_data":{"target_type":"Computing","host_name":"","ip_address":"","mac_address":"","fqdn":"","comments":"","role":"None","is_web_database":false,"technology_area":"","web_db_site":"","web_db_instance":"","classification":null},"cklb_version":"1.0"}
